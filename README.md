# Invoice-Heatmap
Heatmap of the sales based on the filters chosen by the user with some details.

This code has been written specifically for BAT company in order to visualize the sales of the different products on the map based on the filter that the user chooses.

I used CX_ORACLE to connect to the DB of the company and I used folium regarding map creation and visualization.
Here are all libraries that I used or I have plan to use in the future:
{
pandas
cx_Oracle
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy  
pandas  
folium
folium.plugins
tkinter 
tkinter 
tkcalendar
tkinter 
}

The code is not a ready-to-use one, since it is designed for a single target customer. BTW, it has some good functionality in it usable for future use.
